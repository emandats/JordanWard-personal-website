        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> As a Computing & Data Science student at NYU's Leonard Stern School of Business, I am thrilled to merge the
            realms of software engineering and business, ultimately leveraging data-driven insights to transform
            organizations and drive growth in the digital age.

            Through my work with Bank of America, I had the opportunity to lead the development of a mindfulness
            application for the YMCA of the Triangle. During this project, I was responsible for utilizing
            front/back-end systems for seamless integration, gaining hands-on experience with software development
            methodologies. The most rewarding aspect of this project was creating a solution that positively impacted
            people's lives. This experience reinforced my commitment to developing solutions that benefit society and
            highlighted the importance of considering the human impact of technology.

            Additionally, as a participant in NASA’s L’Space Academy, I proposed and developed an electro-mechanical
            tether system to provide power and communications to a rover mission operating within the environment of a
            lunar lava tube. This experience allowed me to apply my software engineering skills to a cutting-edge space
            exploration project. The development of the tether system required critical and creative thinking to design
            a feasible solution within the constraints of space exploration. Collaborating with team members with
            diverse backgrounds and expertise strengthened my ability to work effectively in a team and communicate
            complex technical concepts to a non-technical audience.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my free time, I explore new technologies and experiment with programming languages outside of coursework.
            I work on personal projects to expand my skill set and explore new areas of interest. I am deeply interested
            in the intersectionality of technology and fashion, representing an exciting frontier of innovation and
            creativity. As a computer science student, I am interested in the technical aspects of fashion technology,
            such as wearable devices and machine learning algorithms for personalized fashion recommendations. At the
            same time, I am drawn to the aesthetic and design elements of fashion, and I believe that combining these
            two areas of expertise has the potential to unlock a whole new world of possibilities.

            Whether building new products, optimizing processes, or solving complex challenges, I am eager to bring my
            skills and innovative personality to the table, making a lasting impact.
